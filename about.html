            <h2>About Me:I'm Marai Nasr, an aspiring software developer with a passion for development and problem-solving. I'm driven by the constant challenge this field offers, and the opportunity for continuous learning and growth. Outside of coding, I enjoy playing table tennis and fitnes. I firmly believe in being true to myself and striving for daily improvement. While I don't have prior professional experience in software development, I'm eager to learn and apply my skills in a real-world setting. I consider my adaptability and determination to achieve my goals to be my greatest strengths, and I'm confident these qualities will serve me well in my career. I'm looking forward to new opportunities to learn and grow, and I welcome connections with those interested in software development.</h2>
